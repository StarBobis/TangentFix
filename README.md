# How to use?
Drag your mod's Position.buf on this program, that is all.

Three additional tips if you are making new mod instead of fix old mod's TANGENT:

- hoyo's model use AutoSmooth 89Â° for normals ,you can set it in blender before you export mod,then this algorithm will works better.
- hoyo's model split some point on some sharp edges to get correct normal, if you can do it as like hoyo's model, this algorithm will works better.
- if you merge your model's point by distance before you export, this algorithm will works better.
